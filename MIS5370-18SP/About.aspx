    <h3>Brief Project Background</h3>
    <p>The clinic that was proposed for the project was recently established by three well-known physicians, making it a privately-owned clinic, 
        in West Virginia. The purpose of this clinic was to provide basic, yet essential, services that were desperately needed in such a small 
        community. Although the clinic does offer several services, due to staff and equipment limitation, many elaborate procedures are required 
        to be transferred to other clinics and hospitals that offer such specialized services.</p>
